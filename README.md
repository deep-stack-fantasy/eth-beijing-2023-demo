[DSF Solidity Compiler (solijson.js)](https://124.220.19.52/soljson.js)

Note: Please manually add the URL of [DSF Solidity Compiler (solijson.js)](https://124.220.19.52/soljson.js) in [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=https://124.220.19.52/soljson.js).

Note: our modified compiler is still struggling with `invalid jump` issue. Currently the compiler can successfully generate bytecodes, but these codes are unable to correctly run on our modified EVM. We are working on this issue.

Note: these two links are temporarily hosted in Tencent cloud. It will be broken in the future and we plan to use github pages to serve the compiled `solijson.js` file.
